That's all wonderful, it gives depth and\\nrichness and color to life, but it isn't just about\\nour distracted nature when we're engaging with the phone, it's also a way of layering in dopamine. And it's no surprise\\nthat levels of depression and lack of motivation are\\nreally on the increase. Everything that we've\\ntalked about until now sets up an explanation or interpretation of why interacting with digital technology can potentially lead to disruptions or lowering in baseline\\nlevels of dopamine. I can use a personal example for this. I happen to really enjoy working out, I've always really enjoyed it. But in recent years I noticed that, if I was bringing my phone to my workouts, then not only was I a\\n\\nwhether or not we can, or cannot accomplish something. So how does dopamine\\nwork and what does it do? Well, first of all, it is not\\njust responsible for pleasure, it is responsible for\\nmotivation and drive. Primarily, at the psychological level, also for craving. Those three things are sort of the same. Motivation, drive and craving. It also controls time perception, and we will get deep into how dopamine can modulate time perception, and how important it is\\nthat everybody be able to access increases in dopamine\\nat different timescales. This turns out to be important\\nto not end up addicted to substances, but it also turns out to be\\nvery important to sustain effort and be a happy person\\nover long periods of time. Which I think most everybody wants. It certainly is adaptive in\\nlife to be able to do that. Dopamine is also vitally\\nimportant for movement. I'll explain the neural circuits\\nfor dopamine and mindset, and dopamine in movement in a moment, but in diseases like Parkinson's\\n\\nthat postpartum drop in mood and affect and\\nmotivation is the drop in baseline dopamine. This is very important to understand, because this happens on\\nvery rapid timescales and it can last quite a long time. It also explains the\\nbehavior that most of us are familiar with, of engaging in something\\nthat we really enjoy. Going to a restaurant\\nthat we absolutely love, or engaging in some way with some person that we really, really enjoy. But if we continue to\\nengage in that behavior over and over again, it kind of loses its edge. It starts to kind of\\nfeel less exciting to us. Some of us experienced that\\ndrop in excitement more quickly and more severely than others, but everyone experiences\\nthat to some extent. And this has direct roots\\nin these evolutionarily conserved circuits. Some of you may be hearing this and think, no, no, no, no that's\\nnot how it works for me. I'm just riding higher\\n\\nthe evolution of anyone's life progression too. So they're a good thing. Dopamine is a good thing. Just very briefly, because\\nit was also covered in the interview episode\\nI did with Anna Lembke about addiction. Some of you might be asking, what should I do if I experience a drop in my baseline level of dopamine because of engagement with\\nsome activity or some substance that led to big peaks? Just to put some color\\nand example on this, a few episodes ago I talked about a friend who I've known a long time. So it actually the child of a friend who has basically become\\naddicted to video games, he decided actually after\\nseeing that episode with Anna to do a 30-day complete fast from phone, from video games and from\\nsocial media of all kinds. He's now at day 29 has\\nreally accomplished this, not incidentally, his\\nlevels of concentration, his overall mood are up. He's doing far far better. What he did is hard.
